    * Create event
      * The user presses the “create event” button and a pop-up window appears for event editing
      * A list of existing event types is presented and the user must choose one of these types or choose “create new event type” button. Each event type has a drop-down that lists the input parameters available for that event type
        * Create new event type:
          * The window changes to the create new event type window
          * All possible event parameters are prompted/guided by a series of questions with drop-down menus or input boxes. The questions are short and designed to clearly convey to the user which parameters they should have for their desired event. Many of them will give suggestions of potential use cases that might not be immediately obvious. These aim to inspire the user to become better at using the app and to compel them to explore all of the possible functions of the app
          * The user will also be required to provide a unique name for the event type
          * The user presses “save event type” or cancel to save or discard the changes
          * The window changes back to the create event window, and the new event type will already be selected if the user chose to save it

Our team works in separate for the app. Front-end part and back-end part. In this way, we can choose node as the main server to develop this app.
1. Node js has so much extension that we can add whatever dependency we want for later development, including establish connection with future data base.
2. Most of the data we store or get is base on json file. JavaScript can easily access and modified the data we get from the database or api.
3. Our app aims for fast and stable output for users. For example, every time user login to our website, we don’t want to wait plenty of time to render what we retrieve from the server. For node nature callback function and asynchronous request handling, we can render the data as quick as possible.
4. Our app is an event based app, which is the core of node. User click on something and retrieve from the server is main interaction in this app. Node js can easily handle those event and give results correctly and efficiently.
5. We love node as a development tool. It is easy to learn and extend the functionality.

We don’t really want to use php or jsp because we want our app starts simple and do the right things. Node naturally provides so much dependency that others doesn’t. This is the main reason that we don’t want to use other tools.

END RESULT:  
Node.js + Express for backend and JavaScript for front end. Because we didn't have anyone that did frontend so the Calender code was written using JavaScript.

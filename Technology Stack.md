For this project, we have chosen javascript/dart as the language. Flutter for frontend development and Express for backend.
For database we have chosen mongoDB and MongoChef for GUI.
First of all MongoChef and javascript are suggested by the professor in class. And Javascript has many resouces available online and is easy to learn.

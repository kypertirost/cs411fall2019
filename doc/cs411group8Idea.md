Item locator that finds prices of an item at nearby stores
  * The user inputs what item he/she is looking for, then we search online in major stores (such as bestbuy/target/amazon(which has same day pickup)/cvs/home depot) to see if we can find the items available.
  * If items are available we will try to find the cheapest one and if it is/might be available at a store near the user’s location. And if it is available in a physical store, we can show the user the closest store.
  * For items the app is unsure about, the app can prompt the user to call ahead. The user can later confirm the existence/nonexistence of that item in that store so the app will know in the future.

Map that takes user ratings and suggestions of free outdoor attractions like parks, mountains, picnic spots, abandoned buildings, etc
  * The user can put in his/her current location and we can suggest interesting places around such location
  * Users can suggest/review locations on the map and filter locations based on location categories
  * We can also maybe integrate weather, and only suggest attractions that are good in this weather (such as indoor activities when raining, no hiking when it is very hot outside.)
  * Pulling data from property ownership history can suggest locations that may be abandoned and explorable.

Hobby discovery app that finds the starting items for certain hobbies and their prices to give prices of certain hobbies
  * The user can put in the hobby he/she might be interested in, and we can show them the cost of a starter kit for such hobby. This would require web scraping and a natural language processing api.
  * We can maybe also suggest how much time commitment such hobby usually involves.
  * We can search online on forums/reddit or stores for the prices

Scheduling app that takes your schedule and suggests blocks of time for completing non-time-specific tasks or goals
  * The user inputs his/her calendar schedule, and we can suggest what (hobbies) to do in the free time that are suitable for his/her schedule
  * We can estimate how long a given activity is going to take and only suggest things that can be done in the free time of the schedule. And we can also integrate weather into this, only suggest attractions that are good in this weather (such as indoor activities when raining, no hiking when it is very hot outside.)
  * The users can input what kind of activities they are interested in
  * We can also have multiple users sign in and add each other as friends, and we can automatically show when their free time is overlapping with their friends. Then suggesting activities with friends.
  * We can implement sleep schedule customization and support for polyphasic schedules
  * Reminders for things like medications can also be used so users are never unsure if they have already taken their medication
  * Might implement psychological productivity enhancers like the Pomodoro method

Web Cooking
  * People don’t usually know how to cook things right, or what to cook. This web application can provide two modes with pc/mac platform or phone platform. For the previous, we can just select what we have in the refrigerator and pops up a list that what can you do with this one, with recipe and instruction if we click. In the phone mode, enabling camera and detecting the ingredients you have help you to determine what to eat for your next meal. This app need AI recognition API to determine what the ingredients are and the database to store each user’s information so that they can be provided daily suggestion according to their history.

## do NOT change the files except in app_server/views/html (update in 10.25)
## Author: Miao Liu, Yuyang Huang, Daniel

Here's the way to update the html file we see.

- pull your data
Just pull from the github using `git pull`

- install npm
You have to make sure your npm is correctly installed when your dependencies are updated.
Please mark what dependencies you add in each commit so that the server side can correctly respond to the changes.
`npm install` will help you install whatever you want to use for the app

- edit index.html. This is the temp solution for now. We will use front-end frameworks later.
